**DIJKSHTRA ALGORITHM ACTUALLY FAILS ON GRAPHS HAVING NEGATIVE EDGE WEIGHTS:**
---

**REASONING [MY UNDERSTANDING]:**
---
-> Since in dijkstra we are popping out vertices on sorted order let's say some vertex having negative egde has not been relaxed yet \
-> let x-> y be this edge then if x has the greatest path then it will be iterated over atlast
