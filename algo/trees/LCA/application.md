**APPLYING THE IDEA OF BINARY UPLIFTING AND LOWEST COMMON ANCESTOR:**
--

To find some f(x) between 2 nodes in a tree
--

-> We can compute f(x) from node 1 to node 2 \
-> But how to compute this f(x) fast?\
-> We use the idea of binary uplifting\
-> While uplifting or while finding up values we can record correspondingly the function f(x) and use that f(x) while calculating lca to calculate f(x) between the nodes in log(n)
