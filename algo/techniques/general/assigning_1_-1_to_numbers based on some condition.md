**1/-1 TRICK**
--

-> A lot of problems can be simplified if we break down the wide variety of inputs given to 1 and -1 based on the whether they satisfy some condition or not then we can check whether they satisfy some condition or not as a whole\
-> Most of the time this trick can be combined with binary search\
-> we can also subtract some x from every element sometimes and then do some operations on the remainder to check some validity (for ex: in case of mean if mean of (xi-k) is less than 0 then k cannot be a mean, if k=0 then mean, if k>0 then k is greater than mean)
