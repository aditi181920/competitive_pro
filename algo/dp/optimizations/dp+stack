-> lets say we have dp transition in which we have to find min/max for [j,i] range  for j=[1,i] for all previous dp states\
-> for example:

```sh
   dp[i] = [dp[0]*max(1,2,..,i) + dp[1]*max(2,3,...,i) + dp[2]*max(3,4,5,..,i).... + dp[i-1]*max(i) 
   similarly 
   dp[i] = [dp[0]*min(1,2,..,i) + dp[1]*min(2,3,...,i) + dp[2]*min(3,4,5,..,i).... + dp[i-1]*min(i) 
```
