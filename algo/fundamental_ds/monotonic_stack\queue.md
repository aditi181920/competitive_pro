**MONOTONIC STACK/QUEUE:**
--

-> These are normal stack and queue, just they keep elements in either increasing order or decreasing order 

-> **Increasing order:** If in increasing order, then whenever stack top elements are larger we pop them out\
-> **Decreasing order:** If in decreasing order, then whenever stack top elements are smaller we pop them out

-> These are usually applied in places where we wanna know next smaller,prev smaller (by maintaing increasing seq) or next larger,prev larger element (by maintaing decreasing seq)
