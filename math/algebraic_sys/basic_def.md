BASIC DEFINITIONS:
--
  
  -> If S is a nonempty set. An operation on S is a function * from SxS into S denoted by (S,\*). We usually write a\*b\
  -> An n-ary operation is a function from SxSxSx....xS(n factors) into S
  
  **1. PROPERTIES:**
  ---
  -> 1. Closure: An operation * on set S is said to be closed under * if a\*b belongs to S for any element a and b in S\
  -> 2. Associative: An operation * on set S is said to be associative if for any elements a,b,c in S (a\*b)\*c = a\*(b\*c)\
  -> 3. Commutative: An operation * on set S is said to be commutative if for any elements a,b in S a\*b = b\*a\
  -> 4. Identity: Given an operation * on set S. An element e in S is called an identity elemeny for \*, if for any element a in S  a\*e(right identity)=e\*a(left identity)=a\
  -> 5. Inverse: Given an operation * on set S having an identity element e. Inverse of an element a is  a*(a^(-1)) = a^(-1)\*a = e\
  -> 6. Cancellation law: An operation * on a set S is said to satisfy the left cancellation law or the right cancellation law according as: a\*b = a\*c implies b=c or b\*a = c\*a implies b=c
  
  --> **Semigroup:** prop 1 and 2\
  --> **Monoid:** prop 1,2,4\
  --> **Group:** prop 1,2,4,5\
  --> **abelian/commutative group:** prop 1-5\
  --> **Subsemigroup:** If A is a nonsempty subset of a semigroup S then A is called a subsemigroup of S if A itself is a semigroup w.r.t the operation on S 
  
  **2. Homomorphism, isomorphism of semigrps:**
  -> Given two semigrps (S,\*) and (S',\*'). The function f:S->S' is called a semigrp homomorphism or a homomorphism if  f(a\*b) = f(a)\*'f(b)  or simply f(ab) = f(a)f(b)\
  -> if f is also one-to-one and onto then f is called an isomorphism b/w S and S', and S and S' are said to be isomorphic semigrps
