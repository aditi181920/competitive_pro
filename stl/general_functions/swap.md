SWAP
---
**Prototype: swap(a,b)** \
a,b can be any data type \
Function : swaps the values of both parameters \
Return value: none

**COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:** \
Linear, O(n) for array because each element is swapped \
O(1), constant , for variables and stl containers like vector because address pointers are swapped \
this constt complexity can be used as an advantage in many places
