SWAP
---
**Prototype: swap(a,b)**
a,b can be any data type
Function : swaps the values of both parameters
Return value: none

**COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:**
Linear, O(n) for array because each element is swapped
O(1), constant , for variables and stl containers like vector because address pointers are swapped
this constt complexity can be used as an advantage in many places
