**SOME IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING C++ FUNCTION:**
--
-> To find r=sqrt(a*a + b*b): use r=hypot(a,b)\
-> To find theta using coordinates ... using inverse of provided functions will be caseworky .. so instead we use atan2(b,a)\
-> Some programming languages may give error since atan2(b,a) is not defined mathematically, but C++ handles it so we don;t need to worry there\
-> All arguments accepted and returned in C++ are in radians , so convert by  x=(x*pie)/180
