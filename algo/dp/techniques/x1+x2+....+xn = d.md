**FIND NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF X1,X2,X3,....,XN SUCH THAT X1+X2+..XN = D**
--
Different combinations if rearranging them in any way don't lead them to becoming identical

CASE I : If xi>=0 that is there is no upper bound on the value of xi 
--

In this case, the problem can be solved by simple combinatorics.\
The problem reduces to: Number of ways of distributing k distinct elements to n people such that each can be assigned zero or more\
Consider k objects and n-1 partitions among these we have to choose n-1 paritions so it gives us <sup>n-1+k</sup>C<sub>n-1</sub>

CASE II : If there are upper bounds on all values of xi
--

In this case, we have to use dp to find all combinations since we have a certain upperbound for all objects.\
let dp[i]=we selected total i objects (from n odd numbers available) \
since there is a upperbound on cnt of odd numbers \
we need to keep track of how many numbers of what element we picked as well\
therefore to avoid this we can simply exhaust all count of an odd element at once\
dp[0]=1 base case\
if len-cnti>=0:\
dp[len]+=dp[len-cnti]%mod
