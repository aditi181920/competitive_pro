**Algo:**
--

-> We have a lot of components\
-> Find min edge from this component whose one end belongs to this component and the other belongs to the other component\
-> Find this min edge for all the components \
-> Then start joining the components from smallest edge until only 1 component left


**Note:** Complexity highly depends on implementation
