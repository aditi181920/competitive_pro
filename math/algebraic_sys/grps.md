GROUPS
--

-> satisfies closure, associativity, commutativity, identity, inverse\
-> **ORDER OF GROUP (|G|):** nunber of elements in a grp G\
-> **FINITE GRP:** => finite order

1. SYMMETRIC GRP Sn:
---
  A one-to-one mapping of the set {1,2,...,n} onto itself is called a permutation\
  -> the set of all such permutations is called symmetric grp of degree n and denoted by Sn. There are n! of them.\
  -> identity permutation: for all i, p[i]=i . 
   
2. SUBGROUPS:
---
  A subgrp H of a grp G is a subset H s.t.\
  i. it is closed under operation defined on G\
  ii. has some identity element for that operation (will be eq to identity element of G)\
  iii. for all h belonging to H , the inverse for h in G i.e. h^-1 must be there in H\
  -> intersection of two subgrps is a subgrp
  -> union of two subgrps is almost never a subgrp
  
3. CYCLIC SUBGRP:
---
  -> let G be a grp and *a* be any element in G. Then the set <a> = {a^k: k belongs to set of integers} is a subgrp of G. Also, <a> is the smallest subgrp of G that contains a/
  -> for a belonging to G, <a> is the cyclic subgrp generated by a.\
  -> if G contains some element a s.t. G = <a> then G is a cyclic grp and a is the generator of G.\
  -> If a is an element of a grp G then order of *a* is the smallest positive integer n, s.t. a^n = e and we write |a|=n\
  -> if no such n exists then |a| = infinity
  
  --> every subgrp of a cyclic grp is cyclic
