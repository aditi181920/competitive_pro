SMALL TO LARGE METHOD:
---
The small to large method used in dsu can be used independently which reduces the complexity to nlogn because combining elements of small grp to a larger grp which has size atleast 
double greater than its previous small grp ensures that elements will change grps atmost logn times thereby obtaining a good complexity
