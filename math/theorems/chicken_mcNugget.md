Chicken McNugget Theorem / Postage Stamp Problem / Frobenius Coin Problem
---

```sh
For any two relatively prime positive integers m,n; and non-negative integers a,b
the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form am+bn is:
mn-m-n
```

One of the consequences of this theorem are:
```sh
there are exactly ((m-1)(n-1))/2 positive integers which cannot be expressed in the form am+bn
Proof can be constructed with simple factorization of result from the above mentioned theorem
```
